# Chance Quest

A game loosely based on the risk board game in which a player tries to take over all territories on a game map. Players have limited troops that are distributed throughout the territories that they control. Players can attack adjacent territories as long as they have the troops. Battle outcomes are determined by dice roll.

## MVP

1. A game board with territories that are that are clickable. Displays how many troops are on it at any given time.

2. A scoreboard that displays the total amount of troops that a player has

3. A turn based game logic that can play out moves by checking the territories are adjacent, rolling dice to determine the outcome of a battle, updating the board with new data.

4. A production README that clearly explains the game.

## Wireframes

The game will consist of a primary game board with a panels on the side displaying the amount of troops each player has.

## Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

1. JavaScript
2. Canvas

## Implementation Timeline

Day 1: Setup the node modules and webpack. Work on getting the entry file ready. Work on game board territories game logic.

Day 2: Finish up any game board logic. Begin rendering.

Day 3: Finish up game rendering and integrate with the logic.
